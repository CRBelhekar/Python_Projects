Podcast – Naval,2020-05-14,2,"Groups Search for Consensus, Individuals Search for Truth",https://nav.al/?p=28494141,"What’s considered to be true is fought over. <a href=""https://twitter.com/naval/status/1141844787705741312?s=21"">Individuals search for truth but groups search for consensus</a>—and society is the largest group. So the biggest problem we run into is this: What society wants for you is not always what’s good for you.







Even smart, critical thinkers go along with many of society’s truths, knowing deep down they are lies.&#160;



Here’s a simple example: “Money won’t make you happy”<span class=""post-more-link-before""></span><a class=""post-more-link"" href=""https://nav.al/consensus""> More <i class=""fas fa-chevron-right""></i></a>"
Podcast – Naval,2020-05-14,3,The Path to Peace Is Truth,https://nav.al/?p=28494127,"The search for peace is really the search for truth. Try to see the advantage of understanding things by discovering the truth rather than by practice.







Let’s say I’m trying to quit smoking. There are techniques I can try, but they’re always painful and difficult.

We intuitively know this. When someone is blabbing too much or being the court jester, you know they’re not at peace.

Podcast – Naval,2020-05-14,5,Happiness Is Peace in Motion,https://nav.al/?p=28494094,"In some ways, modern life is more hectic than prehistoric times. Our sources of stress are more chronic.



Let’s define stress. In physical terms, stress happens when something wants to be in two places at one time.

What events do you most look forward to? I’ll bet they’re the ones where you get to drink or do drugs. You look forward to dinnertime, an upcoming party or bar-hopping with friends.
